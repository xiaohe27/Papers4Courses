7. Describe one technical term that you learned in this talk
Infeasible code is the new technical term that I learned. 
It is the code that is either unreachable or will cause the program go into error state.
I also learned a way to detect infeasible code: 1) construct a Control Flow Graph (CFG) for each method 2) construct Abstract Interpretation Flow Graph(AIFG) 3) remove the edges of AIFG from CFG, and then we get the infeasible code candidates, which can be processed in further to remove false positives.
