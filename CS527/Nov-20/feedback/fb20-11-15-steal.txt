Work stealing is the new term that I learned from the talk. It is a well-studied dynamic load balancing strategy which
unleashes the computing power of parallel computing systems, so that the idle computing resources can be thoroughly exploited. 
Each time a computer node becomes idle, by following the provided algorithm, it can steal computing tasks from other nodes, 
which improves the efficiency of computation.
