1. Good point
The paper made use of Z3 SMT solver in solving the coverability problem for Petri nets, and achieved better overall success rate on proving safety properties compared to other state-of-the-art tools.

2. Bad point
In evaluation section, only five benchmarks were used; and one of the benchmarks (namely Bug-tracking) has significant impact on the final results. In fact, if we only consider the first 3 benchmarks, the proposed tool was the worst among all the tools! This makes the overall result not very convincing.

3. Question
The paper mentioned that the proposed technique was not complete, but was that sound?
In the evaluation, only safe examples were used, though it made sense for checking the degree of completeness; however, I am curious about its soundness, i.e. whether the tool may provide safety proof for the unsafe program.
