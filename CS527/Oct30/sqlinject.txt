1. Good point:
This paper carefully summarized the previous approach of identifying, as well as 
preventing SQLI and XSS vulnerabilities; it identified the disadvantages of each existing 
approach and then improved all those drawbacks in the proposed new technique: it works on 
unmodified existing code, creates concrete input, operates before software is deployed, 
able to check the internal of application and no overheads...

2. Bad point:
The proposed tool Ardilla can only generate attacks for a sensitive sink if the input 
generator creates an input that reaches the sink. However, effective input generation for 
PHP is challenging.

3. Question:
Is the attack string generated by the tool Ardilla fixed-size or not?
