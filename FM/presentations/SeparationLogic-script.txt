Title: Overview of Separation Logic

Thank you all for attending my presentation today.

In this presentation, I will introduce separation logic from a beginner's perspective.

=======================================================================================

I will begin with the motivation of separation logic; 



Then I will describe how it extends Hoare logic in three aspects
to facilatate the reasoning of pointer programs.

I will then demonstrate how to use separation logic to verify properties
in a list-reversing program and a tree-copying procedure.

Finally, I will talk about the concept of Iterated Separating Conjunction
and its application in analyzing arrays.
